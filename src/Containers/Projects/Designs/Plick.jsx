            <h1>The challenge</h1>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1rem" }}>
              Plick is a Swedish marketplace platform specializing in
              sustainable fashion with over one million users across Sweden. The
              platform facilitates buying and selling of pre-owned clothing and
              accessories, promoting a circular economy and sustainable
              consumption.
              <br />
              <br />
              Customers often perceive the effort required to resell clothes as
              disproportionate to the perceived value, leading them to discard
              or donate items instead. To address this challenge, I investigated
              how to optimize the listing process, which is a crucial step in
              the selling journey, in order to enhance user experience and
              increase user engagement. By streamlining the process, the goal
              was to make it easier and more efficient for users to create
              listings, ultimately encouraging more sellers to participate and
              contribute to Plick's sustainable marketplace.

            <h1>Design process</h1>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1rem" }}>
              The project was based on a design process called{" "}
              <b>Design Thinking</b>. It suggests that the design process should
              have five phases. Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test.
              It's an iterative process where we repeat until we get the
              expected result.
            </p>
            <h3>Empathize</h3>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>
              In the empathize phase, I conducted a user survey within the app,
              followed by in-depth interviews with selected users. I also
              carried out a competitive analysis to understand the market
              landscape and evaluated the usability of Plick's existing listing
              process using heuristic guidelines. These methods provided
              valuable insights into user needs and pain points, laying a strong
              foundation for the subsequent design stages.

            <h3>Define</h3>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1rem" }}>
              In the define phase, I analyzed the data gathered during the
              empathize phase to pinpoint user needs and pain points. Two
              personas were created to represent key user segments, and user
              stories were developed to capture their goals and challenges.
            </p>
            <h3>Ideate</h3>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1rem" }}>
              In the ideate phase, I began by formulating "How Might We"
              statements, which were later used in a collaborative workshop with
              other UX designers at Plick. These statements inspired a range of
              ideas that became the foundation for sketches and guided the
              development in the prototyping phase.

            <h3>Prototype iteration</h3>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "1rem" }}>
              The prototyping phase followed an iterative process, where various
              design concepts were explored and refined. Initially, two distinct
              low-fidelity prototypes were created and evaluated through the
              first round of user testing. The bar chart presents the results,
              highlighting how users rated their overall experience with each
              concept on a scale of 1 to 5.
              <br />
              <br />
              Based on the results of the user tests, elements from both
              concepts were combined to create the final prototype, utilizing
              Plick's existing design system.
